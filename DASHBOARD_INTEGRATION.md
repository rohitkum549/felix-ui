# Felix Dashboard API Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of the Felix Dashboard with dynamic API data from `http://localhost:4000/api/transactions-and-wallets`.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000` from `.env.local`
- **No hardcoded URLs**: All API endpoints use environment variables

### 2. Type Definitions (`lib/types/dashboard.ts`)
Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for:
- `Transaction`: Individual transaction data structure
- `Service`: Service/project data structure  
- `Wallet`: Wallet data structure
- `Profile`: User profile data
- `User`: User account data
- `WalletBalance`: Wallet balance information
- `DashboardSummary`: Summary statistics
- `DashboardData`: Complete API response structure

### 3. API Service Integration (`lib/api-service.ts`)
- Added `getTransactionsAndWallets()` method to existing API service
- Uses environment variables for base URL configuration
- Maintains existing authentication and error handling patterns

### 4. Custom Hook (`hooks/use-dashboard.ts`)
- `useDashboard()` hook for managing dashboard state
- Handles loading, error, and data states
- Provides `refetch()` function for manual data refresh
- Automatic data fetching on component mount

### 5. Component Architecture

#### Transaction Card (`components/dashboard/transaction-card.tsx`)
- Displays individual transaction details
- Shows transaction direction (sent/received)
- Includes status badges with color coding
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for IDs and hashes
- Responsive design with hover effects

#### Service Card (`components/dashboard/service-card.tsx`)
- Displays service/project information
- Shows rating system (1-5 stars)
- Includes pricing and status information
- Service description and memo display
- Copy functionality for service IDs

### 6. Enhanced Dashboard (`components/dashboard/dashboard.tsx`)

#### Dynamic Statistics Cards
- **BlueDollar Balance**: Calculated from wallet balances data
- **Active Services**: Shows actual service count from API
- **Platform Members**: Displays real user count  
- **Blockchain TPS**: Maintains static value (can be enhanced with real data)

#### Real-Time Data Sections
- **Recent Transactions**: Shows last 5 transactions with full details
- **Recent Services**: Displays latest services in grid layout
- **BlueDollar Analytics**: Updated with real summary data
  - Total Transactions count
  - Total Wallets count  
  - Last Updated timestamp

#### Enhanced UX Features
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading for initial data fetch
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry functionality
- **Refresh Buttons**: Manual data refresh with loading indicators
- **Empty States**: Proper messaging when no data is available

## API Response Mapping

The dashboard now dynamically maps the following API response sections:

```typescript
{
  "transactions": { count, data[] } â†’ Recent Transactions section
  "services": { count, data[] } â†’ Recent Services section  
  "wallets": { count, data[] } â†’ Available for future use
  "profiles": { count, data[] } â†’ User profile integration
  "users": { count, data[] } â†’ Platform member statistics
  "wallet_balances": { count, data[] } â†’ BlueDollar balance calculation
  "summary": { total_transactions, total_wallets, total_tracked_balances, last_updated } â†’ Analytics cards
}
```

## Key Features

### ðŸ”„ Real-Time Updates
- Manual refresh functionality with loading states
- Automatic data fetching on component mount
- Error recovery with retry mechanisms

### ðŸ“± Responsive Design
- Mobile-first responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interaction elements
- Optimized for all screen sizes

### ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced UI/UX
- Glass morphism design consistency
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Color-coded status indicators
- Intuitive copy-to-clipboard functionality

### ðŸ”’ Type Safety
- Full TypeScript integration
- Comprehensive interface definitions
- Runtime type checking

### âš¡ Performance Optimized
- Efficient data fetching patterns
- Conditional rendering for optimal performance
- Skeleton loading states for better UX

## Usage

The dashboard automatically fetches and displays live data when:
1. Component mounts
2. User clicks refresh buttons
3. Data refetch is triggered programmatically

All API calls use the configured environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` ensuring no hardcoded endpoints.

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Data pagination for large datasets
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Export functionality for transactions/services
- Chart visualizations for analytics data
- User-specific data filtering based on authentication

## Testing

To test the integration:
1. Ensure your API server is running on `http://localhost:4000`
2. Start the Next.js development server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to the dashboard to see live data
4. Use refresh buttons to manually update data
5. Test error states by stopping the API server
